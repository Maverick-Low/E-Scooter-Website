Designing an E-Scooter web application

## Description
Our project implements a solution for an e-scooter rental service. This project runs the service on a website where a customer can view the availability of scooters at various locations around leeds. Once a locations is chosen the customer can enter their payment details and then recieve a cofirmation email for their order. If a customer is not logged in they have the option to sign up. Once they are logged in they can also view their order history. Any customer can also submit an issue to be viewed by an employee/admin.

Staff/admin can login using special login details. Staff has the ability to view and escalate the priority of reports submitted by customers. Admins can view higher priority issues.
Staff also has the ability to view all bookings made.
Admim has the ability to manage a scooters location availability as well as add new scooters to the system. The admin can also view the revenue for the past few weeks as well as what hiring option has made the most money in the past week. Higher priority reports can also be viewed by the admin.
The admin can also change the pricing of each of the time options.
